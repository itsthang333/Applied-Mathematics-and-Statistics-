# Applied-Mathematics-and-Statistics-

## Lab01: GaussianApplication:
- Content: Application of the Gaussian (normal) distribution in specific problems.
- Knowledge: Introduction to the Gaussian distribution, its properties. Including: Gaussian Elimination and Back Substitution.

Lab02: ColorCompression:
Content: Color compression in images, reducing the number of colors while maintaining quality.
Knowledge: Introduction to methods of color reduction, such as using the K-means algorithm for color compression, color spaces, and color clustering in images. This lab may involve handling color data and working with color models like RGB or HSV.
Lab03_ImageProcessing:

Content: Basic image processing techniques.
Knowledge: Introduction to image processing techniques, such as color space conversion, filters, edge detection, image transformations (Fourier transform, wavelet transform), and possibly techniques for image enhancement or preprocessing. These are foundational skills in image processing and analysis.
Lab04_LinearRegression:

Content: Implementing linear regression for numerical data.
Knowledge: Simple and multiple linear regression, using regression models for data prediction. This lab introduces concepts such as loss functions, cost function optimization, gradient descent, and applying linear regression to a dataset. It may include calculating regression coefficients and evaluating model accuracy.
